## Introduction

Recently, I had the opportunity to learn about the results of StackOverflow's annual survey, thanks to the folks at Codely. In an interesting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFgnwQ5OapU), they revealed the [highest-paid technologies](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-top-paying-technologies-top-paying-technologies) in the industry. To my surprise, TypeScript, JavaScript, and PHP ranked 29th, 39th, and 50th respectively on a list of 51 languages. Interestingly, the languages I was proficient in were at the bottom of the list. This led me to wonder: What makes the top 10 languages so special? Is there any quality beyond supply and demand that sets them apart?

To answer these questions, I decided to take on the challenge of learning one of the Top 10 languages and discovering it for myself.

## Learning in Public

Coincidentally, during that same week, I came across a [post](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) by **Shawn Wang** where he talked about the benefits of learning in public, sharing the learning process periodically. This inspired me to share everything I learn on this exciting journey through this Technology Blog.

Among all the languages in the Top 10, one in particular caught my attention: [Go](https://go.dev). Its simplicity, performance, and growing popularity intrigued me, so I decided it would be my choice for this exciting challenge.

I firmly believe that the best way to learn specific aspects of a language or library is to dive into its documentation. However, when it comes to learning from scratch, nothing beats having a roadmap to guide us on the right path. For this reason, I'll be using this [specific roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/golang) to learn Go.

If you're also interested in learning about Go and want to join me on this journey, I invite you to follow this Blog, where there will surely be much to discuss and discover together. Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of Go!
